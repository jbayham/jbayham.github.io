## Motivation

Peer review is an essential piece of the scientific process

It provides credibility to scientific research 

Humans are reviewing; the process is not without problems

It is often frustrating but sometimes rewarding

## Publication Process

1. You submit a manuscript and it goes to an editor – usually a senior person with expertise in the area.

2. The editor takes a quick look and makes a decision to “desk reject” or send it along for more in depth review.

3. The editor chooses reviewers based on their knowledge of the field or looking through the references.  Reviewers are not forced but asked to serve.  They may decline but are usually asked to provide alternatives.

4. Return report with recommendation accept, revise, or reject

5. If revise, address comments and resubmit for another round of review

* Certain publications care about the significance of the contribution.  Others don’t.


## Critiquing 
Job of the referee is to provide expert and unambiguous advice to the editor about whether paper is publishable.

Good critique deals with general flow and organization of the paper and the details of the analysis.

We have spent the whole semester talking about “good” research.  Does the paper fit the description of good research.

Make an effort to engage with the material that you are reading.  

  - Ask questions

  - Think about the topic

  - Compare analysis/results with intuition.

## Critiquing cont.

Intend to be critical but with a goal of being constructive.  You are trying to help the author write a better paper.

Be tactful and not rude but you can be direct.  There is a balance.

Imagine you are writing to a colleague

My tone changes if the authors ignore my point or say that they address it but do not.

Avoid telling the authors to write a new paper even if you think this new paper would be more interesting/valuable.  Try to evaluate the paper in front of you.  If it doesn’t succeed, then you need to tell the editor.

Avoid unnecessary self-citation 


## Ethridge guidelines

Clarity

Appropriate/relevant

Technical Details

Contribution

On each point, decide how critical an issue is for publishability

When you get the review, read the paper and think about it for several days then begin to develop the critique.

Golden rule.  Do unto others and you would have them do to you.

## Clarity

Clarity of overall thought?  
  
  - Does the paper guide the reader’s thinking to the objective?

  - Is the flow appropriate

  - Effective and efficient in meeting objective?

  - Organization?

  - Language appropriate/clear/consistent?

You are not a copy editor.  If there are many errors, don’t bother editing.

## Appropriate

Appropriate for intended audience?  

Think about objectives and rank of journal.

The more general the journal the higher the rank because larger audience.  They select topics relevant to broader audience.

May be good for academic tenure case but you may have more impact targeting a topic-specific journal

## Technical Details

Are the methods appropriate?

Are they conducted properly?

You probably cannot estimate someone’s model - may be changing.  Do the results seem reasonable?

You might want to derive analytical results if possible.

## Contribution

Some journals care more than others

Originality.  New perspective?

Policy implications.  How general are the implications?

## Referee Report

Go to the journal’s website and see what format they want the review in.

My report layout

  - Brief summary: helps the editor and conveys that you understood the article
    
    - Objective

    - Method

    - Main finding

  - General comments
    
    - Usually a conceptual critique or some aspect of the analysis with significant implications

## Referee Report cont.

  - Specific comments

    - Itemized list referencing the page number and line number.
    
    - Spelling errors; issues with particular equations; unclear sentences or statements

  - Recommendation to the editor

    - Be clear and justify your rec

    - Try to keep it parsimonious but clear

    - If R&R, then specify what authors need to do
      
      - Robustness check; clarify or explain model or specification


# Response to Reviewers

## Rejection

We will all get rejections.  When rejected, try again.

  - Try not to get angry; remember that this is part of the process and try to learn as much as possible from the experience

  - Rejection doesn’t necessarily mean the paper is bad or wrong.

  - You may want to consider reviewer comments before submitting to a new journal

If a referee misunderstands your paper, it is your fault (probably)

  - It is your responsibility to write a compelling a clear paper

  - The reviewer probably tried to understand the paper so use their comments to figure out what area needs more clarity

## Reasons for Rejection

Boonpramote finds that failure to communicate contribution is the primary reason for rejection based on survey of editors.  Other reasons include:

  - Poor organization: parts do not fit into a coherent whole

  - Poorly written: unclear prose, amateur tone.

  - Failure to connect statistical results with an economic story

  - Failure to motivate story – problematic situation

  - Topic is inappropriate for journal.  This can mean a few things – not large enough contribution, poor fit
  
## Revision

You may get invited to resubmit after making changes

R&R time limit – usually 6-12 months

Revise well before that limit so that referees don’t forget why they liked the paper.  Choi recommends 3mo.

Work on the revisions regularly if not all at once immediately.  This may help you get excited about the project again.

## Revision cont.

If you get asked to revise and resubmit, the editors/reviewers think that your paper has a good idea.  

This may be your last chance to edit so make sure it is a polished final product.  

  - This is hard because there are diminishing returns - getting those last units of improvement may require nontrivial effort levels

Be optimistic and take the opportunity seriously.  

Getting the R&R greatly increases your chance of acceptance.


## Response to Reviewers

Write a detailed response to reviewers

Thank the reviewers (they are usually dedicating time to carefully read your work and provide constructive criticism)

Indicate that you are doing everything reasonable to address the comment.  

  - This may include going beyond to fix of modify something that a comment brought about.
  
If you can’t accommodate a reviewer’s demands, explain to the editor why and hope

Don’t attack the referee.  It probably won’t help your cause.

## Procedure 

Cover letter to the editor explaining what you did to resolve concerns and why you think it should be reconsidered for publication.  

You will also include a response to reviewers, which they will see.

Address each comment directly and thoroughly

Small comments about typos etc can be acknowledged with a thank you and evidence that the change has been made.


## Larger Critiques

Critiques about the conceptual framework, model specification, or some robustness check require much more depth in the response

  - If you agree, thank the reviewer and explain in detail how you fixed the issue. Reference the place in the new manuscript where you addressed the comment.  Copy and paste specific excerpts into the response

  - If you disagree, you need to provide justification for why you do it one way over the reviewers recommendation.

You can technically ask editor questions about comments but I would ask others first

Alert the editor and reviewers to any other substantive changes that you made to the manuscript.  Examples include: model changes, new data, robustness checks.  Also explain why.
