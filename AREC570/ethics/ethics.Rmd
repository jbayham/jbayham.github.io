## Intro

Scientific concesus forms around a body of evidence

Science-based policy recommendations 

Should policy recommendations be made when there is not concensus?



## Paper 
Johnston, B. C., Zeraatkar, D., Han, M. A., Vernooij, R. W., Valli, C., El Dib, R., ... & Bhatia, F. (2019). Unprocessed red meat and processed meat consumption: dietary guideline recommendations from the Nutritional Recommendations (NutriRECS) Consortium. Ann Intern Med, 171, 756-64.

Existing dietary guidelines suggested limited processed and unprocessed red meat consumption

Johnston et al. argue that studies underpinning guidelines aren't well-identified

Conduct systematic review of the literature to assess the strength of evidence

## Systematic Review

Constructed panels (arguably unbiased) to review literature and complete a survey

5 separate systematic reviews

Focus on certainty of evidence

Individual health perspective rather than society, animal welfare, environment

Assessed causal relationship by focusing on cohort studies of red meat intake and dietary patterns

$H_a$: stronger association of negative effects in intake studies

Also evaluated values and preferences toward meat reduction (not clear whether these were econ studies)

## Overview of Findings

Low- to very low-certainty evidence that red meat diets increase risk of heart and cancer issues

Evidence of precise effect is small in magnitude

Estimates unlikely to be causal - effect size and certainty were lower for intake studies compared to dietary patterns

## Certainty

RCT studied small changes in meat consumption; and small sample size

Observational studies limited by ability to measure consumption and dietary patterns 

## Causality

Observational studies limited by measurement error and confounding other dietary factors (omitted variable bias) and preferences (selection)

Cohort studies follow people over long periods and don't control for other confounding


## Conclusions

Recommend a tempored warning - the health evidence for decreasing red meat consumption is weak

## Epilogue

[NYT investigative piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/well/eat/scientist-who-discredited-meat-guidelines-didnt-report-past-food-industry-ties.html) finds that lead author failed to disclose financial ties to business with interest in findings

Similar episode three years prior in review of evidence to reduce sugar

"They're hijacking the scientific process in a disingenuous way to sow doubt and jeopardize public health" - Dr. Dean Schillinger, professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco

Critizised for cherry picking via "high scientific standards"

"Attempts to make dietary guidelines science-based, are doomed to failure because the evidence will never reach high standards of scientific proof," Marion Nestle, professor emeritus of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.

## continued...

"Some people may think that it is ethical to tell people, from a societal perspective, based on low certainty evidence, to stop or reduce their meat consumption.  People should look at the very small risk reductions based on low quality evidence and make their own decisions." - Johnston

## What do you think?

Does the controversy color your intepretation of the evidence?

Are advocates just sour?

Are we as researchers responsible for policy recommendations?

# DeMartino - On the need for professional economic ethics

## Overview

Argument: the economics profession does not "face no pressing ethical quandaries of the sort that would justify an expenditure of intellectual resources on professional ethics."

Economists affect the lives of others, often substantially via policy

## Why needed

1) "Economists' influence comes to them by virtue of their intellectual monopoly over a subject matter that is vital to social welfare; and by virtue of their positions in the public, private and multilateral sectors that sometimes give economists institutional power."

2) economic interventions typically harm some while benefitting others

3) We "can't control and don't know what will be the full impact of the interventions that [we] recommend"

```

http://www.brianwansink.com/

Research on consumer behavior and marketing research around food

## Controversy

Blog post encouraging student to get more out of experimental data (p-hacking)

Researchers reviewed paper and "found conclusions not supported by the data presented, and a total of 150 questionable numbers, such as impossible values, incorrect ANOVA results, and dubious p-values"

Wansink refuted the accusation (Cornell initially backed him up)

Ultimately "17 papers retracted (one twice) and had 15 corrections issued"

Resigned from Cornell effective June 30, 2019

"The practices identified included data falsification, a failure to assure data accuracy and integrity, inappropriate attribution of authorship of research publications, inappropriate research methods, failure to obtain necessary research approvals, and dual publication or submission of research findings."

# Predatory Journals

## Problem

Recognized that researchers face incentives to publish, so create journals that you can pay to publish

Little if any critical review

Initially thought to be a problem in developing countries

Estimates suggest that half of articles have coauthors from WB high and upper-middle income countries
