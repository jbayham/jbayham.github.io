```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Motivation

Articles get retracted all of the time for not being reproducible

Reproducibility is a foundational principle of the scientific process

Many tools now exist to ensure reproducibility so let's use them

Invest effort up front (even if you only internalize a portion of the dividends)


## Basic Process

Acquire and process data

Analyze data

Disseminate: write articles, present research

## Organized Directory Structure

```{r, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/dir_structure.png")
```

## Automation
Automate as much as possible for yourself and others

I strive to maintain a build script that can reproduce my dataset used to estimate regressions (and hope to extend that to produce the paper including figures)

```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bat-file.png")
```


## Version Control

Have you ever appended "v2" or your initials to a draft?

Version control is like track changes and dropbox for code plus other extras that help develop a code project

Github is my preference because well integrated with RStudio (public and private repositories)

Bad form to store large datasets on their servers + unnecessary since they don't change 

See https://happygitwithr.com/ for how to get started using github

## Documentation

Document data sources and steps you take to manipulate the data

Write documentation for others (and your future self) - be as clear as possible

## Tools for data management and analysis
| Software | Learning  | Scope | Community  | Cost |
|----------|-----------|-------|------------|------|
| [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))        | moderate  | extensive | large | free |
| [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))   | moderate* | extensive | large | free |
| [Stata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata)    | easy      | conventional data | econ | high |
| [Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB)   | moderate  | extensive | moderate* | high |


Become proficient in one or two

Other considerations: geospatial, computational speed (solvers), estimators
